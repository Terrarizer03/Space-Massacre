# Space Massacre

An endless wave shooter with roguelike elements. Built in Godot during my first few months of programming. I abandoned it for months until I picked it back up and finished it.

# Features
- **Multiple Enemy Types** – Each with unique movement patterns and attacks
- **Stat Cards** – Random upgrades that shape your build each run
- **Power Ups** – Temporary boosts to help you survive longer
- **Dialogue** – Adds a bit of story and character to the chaos
